# Pomodoro Timer

Simple Pomodoro timer that I made as a way of practicing/learning React. So far it's a functioning timer where you can adjust the time and either 'Start', 'Pause', or 'Reset' the timer. 

**Latest Update:** 13/02/24

### Features :
- Buttons for increasing/decreasing time
- Buttons for Start/Pause/Reset
  - Reset to 25 minutes
- Text stating the current state 'Work' or 'Rest'
- If opening with openInNewWindow file, it opens a Safari Window that is set to the correct resolution.
  - $./openinNewWindow

### To Do : 
  1. Add a sound when the timer ends
  2. Turn into Electron app and all that comes with that
  3. Add sound effects to buttons
  4. Customize button colors and styles, make them cool and pixel style
  5. Implement a settings or a start page to change the work and rest times?
  6. Add animations to the state display instead of text
     a. Make the state display a sprite that is working at a desk when state = work
     b. Make the state display a sprite that is resting when state = rest
